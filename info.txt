TEYVAT
You have arrived in Teyvat â€” a fantasy world where the seven elements flow and converge.
In the distant past, the Archons granted mortals unique elemental abilities. With the help of such powers, people formed a bountiful homeland out of the wilderness. However, 500 years ago, the collapse of an ancient civilization turned the universe upside down...
Though the calamity the world suffered has ceased, peace has yet to be restored.

Liyue
A bountiful harbor that lies in the east of Teyvat.
Mountains stand tall and proud alongside the stone forest, that together with the open plains and lively rivers make up Liyue's bountiful landscape, which shows its unique beauty through each of the four seasons. Just how many gifts from the Geo God lie in wait amongst the rocks of Liyue's mountains?
